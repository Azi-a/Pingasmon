Will use special kinds of codes(?) when it is applicable.

Maybe 2 different keys will work for a value.
ex. name of Human is input, and code is input, both should give human object.



change key to <String[]>?
yes
When accessed using a boolean .contains(), tracer will be able to identify what is valid and what isn't.
It also can return a list of valid keys.


						all are optional(maybe)
Alternate key format- (Type)(Subtype)(Precision modifier)
>Type
h = human

>Subtype
for h
	t = player

>Precision modifier
for h
	t = trainer
	
ID for humans is the same as their standard ID--this is what makes this entire system as useful as it is.
0=Azi's ID

					ex. h p 0 = Azi









key[]|value
[Azi,]	|	Humans/Azi/azi.dat
