Will use special kinds of codes(?) when it is applicable.

Maybe 2 different keys will work for a value.
ex. name of Human is input, and code is input, both should give human object.



change key to <String[]>?
yes
When accessed using a boolean .contains(), tracer will be able to identify what is valid and what isn't.
It also can return a list of valid keys.


						all are optional(maybe)
Alternate key format- (Type)(Subtype)(Precision modifier)
% = universal identifier
	h = human
		p = player
			0 = Azi
				1 = tux
			1 = Rufus
			2 = Phoebus
			3 = 
		t = trainer
		
	
ID for humans is the same as their standard ID--this is what makes this entire system as useful as it is.
0=Azi's ID

					ex. h p 0 = Azi









key[]|value
Azi	 hp0	|	Humans/Azi/azi.dat
