Yes. This technically is the very first file of the project. But it, by FAR. and i mean by FAR. Is not anywhere near the beginning of the ideas I'm going to use in this project. Nothing even remotely close. I guess I should celebrate. But I know deeply that's not what I want to do right now, nor is it what I came to do.
I will explain portfolio mode, this file, and the game as a whole when I get the chance. This is merely a first step.
Nobody said it had to be noteworthy, memorable, or grand in any way.



It's just the first step towards what I want. Nothing more. And I don't really feel like editing this later. I have no real reason or want to. 
But I will get a bit sappy because I feel I must. If you are reading this right know, as one of the members of the original Genesis group from 8th grade, you know what I mean when I say thank you for all your support, love, and ideas for the game...and thank you for playing and caring about it for this long. It's always meant the world to me ever since the day this huge journey has started for all of us.
And I really, truly mean it.
