yeah it exists.
There is some stuff that might be subject to copyright law.
All I want for now is to make clear I won't tolerate bigwigged and greedy corporate scumbags from sapping my project's original ideas.
I will enforce whatever legal action is needed should something form someone of the like(in all honesty anyone who sells stocks is a good way to put it), only obsessed with profits and heartless, from taking out of my ideas. I'll freaking invest in you guys later. So stop abusing your legal power.

Thank you very much, as usual, for reading all this.
